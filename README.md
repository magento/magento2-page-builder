# magento2-page-builder

PageBuilder is a Content Management System(CMS) module for Magento 2.3 and above.
It replaces the default WYSIWYG Editor in the Admin area with a highly configurable drag-and-drop editing system.

## PageBuilder Early Access Program

The PageBuilder Early Access Program (EAP) gives partners the following perks:

* Explore PageBuilder extension points to build custom modules and integrations for 3rd party services, such as Facebook, Instagram, etc.
* Try out PageBuilder customization options and extend its functionality beyond its default features.
* Preview PageBuilder to prepare a migration plan from BlueFoot 1.0 to PageBuilder.
 
**Note:**
*This program should not be used to design and launch a production website using early code.*
