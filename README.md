# Magento 2 Page Builder

Welcome to the Magento 2 Page Builder project!

## Overview

Page Builder introduces an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface for creating digital content, powered by content types like images, videos, banners, etc. with instant preview capabilities that enable non-technical users to take control of their content. It allows to create new pages, enrich products and categories, and launch content updates quickly and easily without the help of a front-end web developer.
