# Contributing to Magento 2 Page Builder code

Contributions to the Magento 2 Page Builder codebase are done using the fork & pull model.
This contribution model has contributors maintaining their own fork of the Magento 2 Page Builder repository.
The forked repository is then used to submit a request to the base repository to "pull" a set of changes.
For more information on pull requests please refer to [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Contributions can take the form of new components or features, changes to existing features, tests, documentation (such as developer guides, user guides, examples, or specifications), bug fixes or optimizations.

The Magento 2 Page Builder development team or community maintainers will review all issues and contributions submitted by the community of developers in the first in, first out order.
During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor.
If there is no response from the contributor within two weeks, the pull request will be closed.

For more detailed information on contribution please read our [beginners guide](https://github.com/magento/magento2/wiki/Getting-Started).
