# What is Page Builder?

Page Builder is a Magento extension for creating content by dragging-and-dropping pre-built controls.Â 
We call these controls "content types." The available content types are shown in Page Builder's menu:

![Page Builder content types](images/pagebuilder-content-types.png){:width="615px" height="auto"}

These content types provide several key features, including:

- **Drag-and-drop** functionality for content creation.
- **Live previews** of how the content will look on the storefront.
- **Form editors** for entering and customizing the content.

For end-users, this means _no coding required_. For you as a developer, it means you will use content types to customize Page Builder in order to meet the end-user's needs. There are two ways to customize Page Builder using content types:

- **Extend** existing content types
- **Create** new content types

This documentation describes how to do both.
